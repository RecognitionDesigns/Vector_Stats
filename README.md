# Vector_Stats

!!! Required !!!
OSKR from DDL

Using the SDK and OSKR we can retrieve stats files from Vector and pick out various bits of information to use in our script.

This script saves a copy of the 'vic.RobotLifetimeStats.json' and 'vic.RobotSettings.json' files to the same directory as this script. As they are copies, your Vector will remain unchanged and you can safely delete the copied files if you wish.
